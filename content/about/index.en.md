Welcome to the **Algorithms Club** (**Club de Algoritmia**), a group founded by students of the **University of Seville** with the aim of learning and perfecting programming skills through collaboration and participation in competitions.

Originally created for students from the **Higher Technical School of Computer Engineering** and the **Faculty of Mathematics**, our club has expanded to include members from various faculties and schools.

At the Algorithms Club, we firmly believe in the value of tackling algorithmic challenges and programming problems. These types of skills are not only crucial for competitions but are also highly valued in the technical assessments of many large companies. Our objective is to offer a platform where members can enhance their abilities, share knowledge, and prepare for their professional future.

Join us and become part of a community passionate about programming, where every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow together.

# 📚 Academic Activities

## Training Sessions

Every Friday, we organise training sessions where we practise problem-solving on platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank. Before we start, our administrators introduce the different strategies, algorithms, or data structures necessary to tackle the problems.

Everyone participates to learn and support each other, so don't be afraid if you think you don't know enough about programming\!

## Student and Industry Talks

We organise sessions every Friday on topics related to competitive programming. This year, we are also introducing a new series of talks with speakers from academia, industry, and alumni, who will cover a wide range of subjects. Attendance at the talks is open to everyone, so you don't need to be a member of the CAUS or a student at the US.

  - Check the upcoming talks [in the news section](/news/) (available only in Spanish).
  - [Give your own talk\!](https://forms.gle/yY9WpbA6Lof41ufa7) If you are a professional passionate about technology and eager to share your knowledge, we would be delighted to have you. If you are a student, this is a great opportunity to delve deeper into a topic that interests you and boost your CV 😉

## Programming Competitions

We participate in annual events such as [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and the [Ada Byron University Programming Contest](http://ada-byron.es/). Additionally, we organise [our own programming competitions](/news/2024-10-27-complicaus-2/) (Spanish only), with enticing prizes, to keep ourselves constantly practising and learning.

# 🎉 Social Activities

## Quarterly Meal

Each term, we organise a special meal to celebrate our achievements and enjoy time as a team. This is an excellent opportunity to share a memorable meal and get to know the people in the group you haven't met yet.

## Climbing Wall

What better way to train those programmer fingers than a good climbing session? Every now and then, we organise unofficial outings to the climbing wall for some exercise after the Friday sessions. It's an excellent opportunity to challenge oneself and strengthen the group spirit\!
